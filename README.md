A sample web application for web.py. In brief, the application fetches a list of open job positions from the github jobs API, groups them by the company and lists them in a fashion way (actually in Pinterest style).

To run the application, just type on the command line:

`python index.py`

The server will listen to port 8080 by default.

That's all about it.
